EXERCISE 1:
    Display contents of directory
    
    Write a program that asks the user for a directory, and then displays the 
    characteristics of that directory.
    
    The characteristics include:
        - permissions of that directory (for owner, group, all)
        - contents of that directory (with the option to list contents of 
        subdirectories recursively)
