1:  Display a vertical pattern in cli.
    Example:
    
    test
    test test
    test test test
    test test test test 
    test test test test test 
    test test test test test test 
    test test test test test
    test test test test
    test test test 
    test test 
    test
    
    
2:  Display a diamond shaped pattern in cli.
    Example:
    
            test
         test test
       test test test
     test test test test 
       test test test
         test test 
            test
            
            
    Alternative example:
            aa
          aaaaaa 
        aaaaaaaaaa
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa    
      aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
        aaaaaaaaaa
          aaaaaa
            aa
            
    (The alternative example circumvents the problem of spacing of a string 
    as pattern).

3:  Display contents of directory
    
    Write a program that asks the user for a directory, and then displays the 
    contents of the directory as a tree.   
    
    
    
        
4:  Random text generator

    This program generates random text and dsiplays statistics about the text.
    The random text is saved into plain .txt-files(s). Storing the text can be 
    spread over multiple .txt-files.
    
    Text files should have limits:
        255 characters per line
        1 million lines per file
        
    - User input is required to specify the number of text files to write to.
    - User input is also required to specify *where* to store the output files.
    - User input is also required to specify the type of characters allowed to be 
    output (numbers, alphanumerical, punctuation characters, combinations and/or
    exclusion of certain or sets of characters, etc)
    
    
5:  Horoscope

    User is asked for his b-day. Bday must be given in ISO 8601 format 
    (yyyy-mm-dd). The program then displays the astrological sign of the user.
